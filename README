NetBSD's wtf(6) command for Void Linux
======================================

The wtf utility displays the expansion of the acronyms specified on the
command line.  If the acronym is not in any of the acronyms databases,
wtf will check to see if the acronym is known by whatis(1), xbps-bin(8),
or xbps-repo(8) show commands.
